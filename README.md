This is Treasure Tumble (previously known as Gravity Game!)
Designed by Jacob Surovsky

For 2 (or more) players

YOU are an archaeolgist exploring the ruins of an ancient treasure chamber. However, all of the treasure has been hidden within sophisticated ancient contraptions. Your goal is to reconstruct the chamber's mechanisms to drop as much treasure as possible into your collection bin. But be warned, rival archaeoligists have also discovered the site, and are attempting to collect the treasure before you. Can you collect more treasure without destroying the ancient remains?

# <strong> HOW TO PLAY </strong><br>
Best played with 12 or more blinks.
Treasure Tumble is intended to be played vertically building off of your sushi roll case.

<strong> SETUP </strong> <br>
Load the game onto all of your blinks, and lay out your magnetic sushi roll case on a flat surface.
Take 2 blinks and long press them until they flash white. When you release them they should both be Orange with one Yellow face. These are you Treasure Bins. Place both bins on their edge on the sushi roll, and place one more blink between them elevated above the sushi roll. 
The yellow faces on the treasure bins should both now point down towards the table. This is the foundation of the ancient treasure chamber.
Each player will claim a treasure bin as their own, either on the left or right. 
Take 1 blink and long press it twice. It should be green with one swirling face. This is your Spawner piece. Set it aside for now.

<strong> PLAY </strong><br>
The goal of the game is to fill your treasure bin with treasure before your opponent. 
Players take turns performing actions until the game is over.

There are four kinds of chamber pieces:
GO-SIDES: Go sides are orange on their bottom half, with dark faces pointing wherever the treasure will go. Picture them like funnels or ledges to redirect the treasure.
SWITCHERS: Switchers have one purple face and one orange face. They will direct treasure falling into them down in the direction of their orange face, then they will switch to point the other way for the next treasure.
SPLITTERS: Splitters are purple and blue. When treasure falls into them, they send 3 treasure pieces out through their 3 bottom faces.
DEATHTRAPS: Deathtraps are red and white. Deathtraps destroy any treasure that falls into them.

Build towers and see how treasure falls into the bins.
