15 Minutes

You are an archaeologist who has finally uncovered a long rumored ancient treasure chamber. Glorious riches await you hidden in these walls, but not without their challenges. Your excavations have unearthed ancient mechanisms that redirect treasure falling from great heights, how much can you now collect in your treasure buckets? 


SETUP


Take your sushi roll case and lay it out on a flat surface. This will be the floor of your treasure chamber. 
Long press 2 Blinks until they flash white, then set them standing up on the sushi roll case. These are your treasure buckets. 
Take another blink and set it between the two buckets. This trio of blinks is the base of your treasure chamber.


Finally, take at least 1 Blink and triple click it. It should now be green with a swirling face. This Blink is your treasure spawner. It will drop one treasure piece whenever it is placed on top of the treasure chamber tower. 

GAMEPLAY
The goal of this game is to collect as much treasure in your bucket as possible by using the mechanisms built into the treasure chamber walls. There are four kinds of mechanisms that will automatically be assigned depending on their position on the tower. 

Funnels: Funnels take treasure falling in from any direction and send it in the direction of their darkened face. 

Switchers: Switchers behave like a see-saw. Once they send treasure in the direction of their orange face they switch sides.

Splitters: Splitters turn one treasure piece into 3 and drop one piece out of each face on their bottom half.

Deathtraps: Deathtraps destroy any treasure that is unlucky enough to fall their way.

This game is played in two stages. First, both players work together to assemble the treasure chamber. Take turns adding one blink at a time to the tower and watching the mechanisms self-assign. 

Once the tower is built, it’s time for the treasure to tumble. 

Continuing to take turns, players must first take the spawner off the tower and set it aside, then remove a chunk of 3 Blinks anywhere from the tower. 

Then the player must add those 3 Blinks back to the tower one at a time in any configuration as long as the tower doesn’t collapse, with the goal of building a path that directs treasure to their bucket. 

Once the tower is re-assembled, the spawner is added back to the tower. The spawner must be placed at the highest point currently on the tower, so plan your reconstructing appropriately. 

Once the treasure tumbles down to the bottoms and the buckets have collected their treasure, the next player’s turn begins.

WIN CONDITION

The first player to fill their bucket with treasure is the winner. When the bucket is full it will turn purple.

If one of the players causes the tower to collapse, they must empty the treasure from their bucket. Double click a bucket to empty it. Then the first stage of the game is repeated and the tower is reassembled before treasure is allowed to tumble again.

ALTERNATIVE PLAY

In addition to being a game, Treasure Tumble can be played as an open-ended toy. Stack elaborate towers and watch the treasure satisfyingly tumble down to the bottom. 

To aid in this open ended play, you can double click any spawner piece to make it auto-drop a piece of treasure every 2 seconds.
